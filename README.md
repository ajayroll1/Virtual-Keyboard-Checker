# Virtual-Keyboard-Checker
This JavaScript enhances an HTML/CSS virtual keyboard by updating key states dynamically. It listens for `keydown` and `keyup` events to add/remove the `active` class, highlighting keys accordingly. Additionally, click interactions toggle the `active` class, visually representing both keyboard and mouse inputs.
